# Sentiment Project

This 14-week project provides students with comprehensive hands-on experience in quantitative finance by challenging them to explore whether financial news sentiment can predict stock price movements and volatility for developing trading strategies. Students will collect and process financial news articles and social media data, apply advanced NLP techniques including sentiment analysis using tools like FinBERT and other transformer models, and integrate these sentiment indicators with traditional market data to build and backtest trading models. The project requires proficiency in Python programming, NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face), statistical modeling and time series analysis (regression, ARIMA, GARCH), and financial data analysis, utilizing data sources such as NewsAPI, Yahoo Finance, and Alpha Vantage alongside analytical tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. Through this comprehensive approach, students gain practical experience in applying cutting-edge NLP to financial text analysis, developing sentiment-driven trading signals, and understanding the real-world challenges of incorporating alternative data sources into quantitative trading strategies.RetryClaude can make mistakes.
